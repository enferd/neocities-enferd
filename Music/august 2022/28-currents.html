                    <br>

                    <p>
                        im going to try my hand as a music critic although im not one, everyone knows tame impala right? the one person gang that makes sad "my girl left me" music
                        i really like tame impala ngl, it's been so far one of those few bands i keep thinking "how did i not listen to it sooner?" as it would be music perfect
                        for little enð, the same enð that would indulge in listening to cornelius' fantasma and gorillaz' demon days if you get the feeling, tame impala makes a lot
                        of music in this vein, of "grandiose"? but chill music with this constant feeling of remorse or nostalgia. <br>
                        <br>
                        going to the music itself, im gonna have to say i prefer lonerism a lot more, as that album has a lot more hidden gems than here if thats any indicator of music
                        i like lol. but really, thing is, i came in too late to tame impala thus i have already listened to some of the music in this album through other people
                        so im not surprised at stuff like let it happen or the less i know the better. i have to say this album has bangers though, after let it happen, i love nangs
                        which is just so rich in melody and percussion, and i really enjoy the precursor to the less i know the better, gossip, as it does prepare us greatly for the
                        entrance of "the big song", but im not a fan of the "lonerism"-vibe i feel in the moment through to eventually, they almost feel like filler? surely aren't but
                        i do feel them like so. then there's the songs after the less i know the better that change the pace weirdly but acceptably, by my first listen i would've 
                        believed that past life was the last song in the track, and it isn't the only track that felt like that, reality in motion, and love/paranoia both feel like the
                        end so it feels really really weird how it just keeps going, and i do like new person, same old mistakes, it just feels really weird that there's so many 
                        "end songs" just after the real end song. <br>
                        <br>
                        as for the general vibe of the album i like it, but it's just so same-y to lonerism that it hurts sometimes, at least for me that i enjoy new stuff constantly
                        this album has it's new things but i just don't like it when i feel it goes back to lonerism in some way, but yeah that's my bias<br>
                        <br>
                        as for rating i'll go with a happy face, as it's better than a meh but worse than the best: :)<br>
