                    <p>
                        so ive been away, again, work's been torturing me in a weird way of keeping my aσs half in alert and half deαd inside due to the "sψrμm methodology" 
                        of having a daily meeting, a meeting to organize whats discussed in those meetings, a meeting to analyze what went wrong in other meetings,..., until 
                        the morst meeting which is a meeting to "bond the teams" with some half-aσsed online game that most of the time boils down to 
                        "wow what a cool hobby each member has, aren't you like family now?". i don't wanna rant all blog about this but needless to say, this need to be in 
                        constant meetings has numbed my brainbdown, and it doesn't help that the only task i've been given is no less than a full printf-athon (obv in cøβºl) 
                        to print a full excel as an ASCII table, work has not been fond of me...<br>
                        <br>
                        talking about suffering, uni hasn't been the utter best, had a somewhat big argument with my family about whether or not to keep studying a engineer career 
                        or to rather go study scientific things more in-depth as it's been the only interesting part of my time here, but they wanted me to stay at a "job-securing degree" 
                        rather than dwelve in poverty due to "wasting my time in academia", sigh<br>
                        <br>
                        the good part at least is that i'm somewhat still not fully depressed, i still want to keep at it so i can indulge in my pleasures, which talking about, my gf 
                        showed me some music lately and for the first time in a while i've enjoyed listening to music really, Alan Parsons and stuff along that, and i myself got into 
                        some cool stuff like <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/siddiq-vektroid/midnight-run/">Vektroid and Siddiq</a> and some Hexd/robloxcore 
                        (yes i'm serious) artists like <a href="https://li.sten.to/lungskull">lungskull</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kempachii">kempachii</a>, so i 
                        haven't been completely fazed out.<br>
                        <br>
                        as for art, and thus this page, as of writing i haven't done anything due to everything, but i hope i'll start pumping stuff soon as i've been more and more 
                        inspired to just quit any social media that's not social in nature (iñ§taγρam and τwɨτt€r for example) and focusing more in either being more social myself 
                        or analyzing myself and thus working on more art, so hopefully i'll finally start working a bit more in myself.<br>
