# Update on the page

i still haven't even added the blog functionality but i'm still writing a second blog post heh, progress on my learning of javascript is going along nicely, i still need to set what i'll be doing to the page as i have three fixed ideas:

- set it as a blog-per-page kind of site
  ![posible design](../Images/design-for-bpp.png)
  
  - pros:
    - keeps the page relatively lightweight and static
    - easier to code as i would only need to set up a linking page and the base for the blogposts
    - lets me try different styles without much need for automation in the page
    - if i can't find a way to use markdown i can just transfer to html and wouldn't have to do any scripting
  - cons:
    - could become a clustef' of files and a navigation nightmare
    - ehhh maybe it'll be ugly or something
