                    <br>

                    <p>
                        now that most of the "framework" (or set of htmls i can copy-paste ad nauseam) for at the very least, the blog is set, its time i expand to the other sides of
                        the page, more so art, as it'll be an engineering task on how to set it up, for brainstorming i have two plans, first of all is the grouping of the images, 
                        as i have both what i call "collages" of images, and more so "tests" of individual images with various effects, ill try and pick a few of them and post them 
                        as is, the second is the group of a grouping, as various of the tests and collages have various different versions so they'll be a gallery of select images
                        with different variations. <br>
                        <br>
                        but then i jump into importing the images into neocities, as ill have to work through transforming a s' ton of bmps and pngs into webps, but i guess theres
                        bash script that'll help me set it up. <br>
                        <br>
                        the art gallery itself should be easier to implement than the blog tho, as its not like it will have some big functionality, it should just display images, and at
                        most a description of the image, so im chill about it, also as the responsive design is already implemented, it shouldnt be a big hassle to port it for phones too,
                        tho i still have that weird bug with phones, but hopefully ill fix it by the time i finish the art gallery... <br>
                        <br>
                        btw i forget this is a blog, so lets update a bit on my life, things are going rather fine, got a few weird dreams lately, but i guess ill post about them later down
                        the line when i can focus more on myself, i finally got the date when ill sign a contract for my first dev job as a <spoiler tabindex="0">¢øßøł</spoiler> developer (i know, at 
                        least it pays), so that will be cool, also im moving really soon, and closer to the office i think ill be working at, so that's also good news. on the other side
                        i just havent been able to pay full attention at college so if theres a downside to it all its that heheh
