                    <p>
                        well i did just dissapear for two months over here, that was mostly due to having all the tests (which most of them i did poorly) and having a lot of
                        other stuff to work on, but now i have settled down for a bit i can start working a lil more in this corner of the internet. <br>
                        <br>
                        for updates: i also started doing a bit more in general, the tests did take a lot of time but i also started going to a computer museum to volunteer 
                        and got into a project to fix an IßM ÆS/4°°e, which would be fun if it wasn't just a pain in documentation and software digging. after that i finally got 
                        working in a bank (tho as of writing i haven't gotten a task to do heh), and i've been reading quite a bit (got my hands full with some of 
                        <a href="https://flesh-network.ddns.net/">knoten's</a> writings and had to add a few wrinkles to my otherwise smooth brain to understand their genius uwu) 
                        also been reading a weird sci-fi "Computer Connection" by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Bester">Alfred Bester</a> (best known for The 
                        Demolished Man) but i don't really know him much, really weird book, maybe i'll do a small review once i finish it. <br>
                        <br>
                        other than that it's been a little bit eventful in my social life (another reason for my abcense) but that too has calmed down, for now my motivation here
                        will be continuing where i left off, working a lil bit in the art gallery as it's missing some descriptions, adding the coding section and searching for 
                        things to post there, and finishing with the other two secctions (music and links) with what i can gather, hopefully soon enough i'll have a page to boast
                        along my other fellow <a href="https://flesh-network.ddns.net/webring">webring-workers</a>. <br>
                        <br>
                        on a side note before wrapping up: i also played and finished cruelty squad, i can't recommend it enough, at least if you like the gore-like aspect of this 
                        page, it was a game i wanted to play since its release and i just couldn't but now that i did i find it amazing, even got me a lil bit closer into the 
                        speedy fpses so maybe i'll give other games like that a spin (still have to finish deus ex tho), and also been playing hypnospace outlaw with my gf, really 
                        really comfy game to play and chill (so far we didn't really play a lot heh), if you like the geocities vibe (i know you do why wouldn't you be here) then
                        you'll dig the game. <br>
                        <br>
                        ps: i did completely forget that i did finish 1984 and i enjoyed the ending a lot, it was quite an enjoyable book to get through and after comp conn ill prolly 
                        get into do androids dream of electric sheep or something.
