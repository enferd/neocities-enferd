# starting this idea

the idea of a blog just sprang up from the nothingness of a webpage, what do you even design a webpage for? only art seemed way to cliche, and doing art + programming wasn't doing it much justice either, a blog was a bit out of the ordinary at least.  

what do you even write about in a blog? well i can tell you about how weird and hard it is to search blogging methods that don't include some thousand-library typescript-rails-on-haskell magic or wordpress/blogpost. if you see this blog then you'll know i've burnt my brain trying to come up with an idea that doesn't include too much scripting and more so with other people's work...  

it's a sort of weird cycle whenever i do these things, start a project i have close to zero knowledge and technique on, and then f' my mind searching the answers in google heh, at least this time i have a whole circle of friends to back me up, i do hope i'll finish the setup soon so i can start doing all the funky stuff i have planned, would love it to be able to just upload files to the page and them showing up instantly.  

changing subject, have you ever written a blogpost in vscode? weirdest s' that i've ever done, really wonky to see all the time i use the word "weird" so easily hahaha, hopefully i'll get better at writing these blogs with time.
