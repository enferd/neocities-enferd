                    one of my later edits, that was when i was still actively writing the <a href"../../../not_found.html">guide</a> and i was at the very last 
					part writing on some vst effects, the main one used for this edit is called "dBlue Glitch v1.4" (i think thats the version), really 
					good plugin, it was also my go to effect when i was still making music. <br> <br>
					as for the picture taken, it is another one of the pics i took with my old digital camera, i always walked through that bridge when coming 
					back to my old home from a party or something and liked to watch through it, it was neither an interesting bridge nor a good day to take
					the picture, but i guess something got me interested. <br>
