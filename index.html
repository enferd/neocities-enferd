          <p>this is my small page i'm planning to update overtime to keep me researching and trying stuff. i'm kinda a jack-of-all-trades sort of guy so you'll see a lot of stuff sorted into at least 5 main categories: <br><br>
            → blog: where i'll just talk about general projects and random stuff that happens <br>
            → coding: where i'll write about what i code up, nothing specific for now heheheh <br>
            → art: where i'll put the mambo jambo rambles about weird art-sy ways to make stuff, like for example, the wallpaper <br>
            → music: where i'll just go into tangents about music i've been listening to and how weird and freaky they can be sometimes <br>
            → links: where i'll post random links of pages i find about and around <br>
